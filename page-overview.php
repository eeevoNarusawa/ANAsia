          <div class="p-overview-profile--msg">I had opportunities to meet a lots of people during my 15 years in Japan. I also found is difficult that people of various cultures and races with different language work together under the same roof. On the back of this, I started up AN Asia to bridge Japan and Malaysia utilizing Japanese-speakers group network through “Malaysia-Japan study abroad reunion” that I established in 2010.</div>

          <div class="p-overview-profile--msg">
            As I am doing business in Malaysia, I realized that many management have a lots of trouble due to high career mobility. Why career mobility is high? – just because of job mismatches in the job market and lack of communication. We started AN Asia with a focus on the right job fit. We also offer Japan Business Ability Qualification Exam (JBAA) for job seekers to learn Japanese business etiquette and culture.
            We believe JBAA program will help to sort problems for both employers and job seekers. We are professional, dedicated and passionate. AN Asia will help both employers and job seekers to best match the right people to the right jobs in your company.
